			<p> Our ISP term project is a client management web application utilizing php and sql
				databases of the type InnoDB. The application allows users to keep track of projects that are
				being worked on and the clients that contracted them. Thus, the application has 9 database tables:
				attachments, clients, contacts, events, milestones, phones, projects, tasks, and users. These tables
				all work to help developers keep track of the development of projects, information on clients,
				and various other utilities. So far, the project consists of various files that can be broken into the
				three following categories: the database itself, the controllers, and the models. Here, the models
				are the various objects in the database, such as the client and project objects, and the controllers
				are the methods that call or change these objects. The architecture we are using for this project is
				the model-view-controller architecture (MVC). MVC helps to separate the application into three
				logical components: the model, the view, and the controller. In our application, the three
				components are implemented as described above, with the database being the model.
