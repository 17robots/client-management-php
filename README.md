## Issue Contribution
*Adopted from [this guide](https://medium.com/nyc-planning-digital/writing-a-proper-github-issue-97427d62a20f)*
1. **Look At What Has Already Been Submitted.** If it's there, feel free to add a 
message with your experience so we can look at what might be causing the 
problem. THe more examples we have, the better, however, the best way to deal 
with it is with them all consolidated into one issue
2. **Keep Issues Separate** Any time you need to add the word and in a title is 
almost a dead give away that the issue you are posting is better off split up. 
Keeping a single idea, enhancement, or bug limited to 1 issue at a time properly 
ensures they are assigned and worked on and completed and that no area of the 
issue is missed.
3. **Show Us What You Mean** If the issue you are posting would be better
enhanced with a screenshot, add a screenshot. If the issue is best explained by 
a video or gif, include that! Being able to format and include these with 
markdown will save us significant amounts of time when dealing with bugs or 
issues if we can just see the problem and not have to play 20 Questions.
4. **Keep Titles Short And Descriptive** Not too much to add here, but please
treat an issue title like an email subject so that when it's combed through, we
can get a general idea of the main issue or request that you are trying to 
address so that we do not have to click in and read every single issue's 
description to find out what's going on. As a side note, please also use the 
imperative form for issues. For example, "Click On About Page 404 Error" or 
"Screen Refresh On Upload Clear Attachment"
5. **Use Proper Tags** When putting an issue in, the wrong tag is practically 
worse than no tag at all. If the issue is a bug, add the bug tag, and if the 
issue is an enhancement, use the enhancement tag. If you are unsure about which 
tag needs applied, use the "Needs Sorted" Tag. We will sift through those 
and decide where it belongs fairly regularly.
6. **If You Can Reproduce, Tell Us** If you have a bug but there are specific 
steps needed to achieve the bug, then tell us those steps. If you have a video 
or gif of the whole thing, even better, but sometimes a screenshot will not 
always do an issue justice. So, if steps are needed to reproduce the bug, then 
please include those in the body of the issue.  

## Code Contribution

### Git Branching
When working to contribute code, create a separate branch named Issue followed 
by the issue the branch is targeting. For example, if you want to fix issue 3 
then create a branch called Issue3. If you want to make a branch to fix issue 
15, then call it Issue15.

### Commits
Follow this guide when making commits that are not closing out the issue you 
are working on: [How To Write Good Commit Messages: A Practical Guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/writing-good-commit-messages-a-practical-guide/).

Here is an infographic involving the commit messages:

*from https://hashnode.com/post/which-commit-message-convention-do-you-use-at-work-ck3e4jbdd00zyo4s1h7mc7e0g*

For commits that close out the issue you are working on, Use the following for 
automation purposes: `Fix #[Insert Issue Number Here]` For example, if you 
complete issue #3, then use the commit `Fix #3` or if you finish issue 15, use 
`Fix #15`
